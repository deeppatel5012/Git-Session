# Git Session

This repository is created for learning purposes.  
The code in this project was taken from Claude AI and is not my real portfolio.

I'm using this repository to practice how Git works with GitHub and to remember the steps involved in pushing code from a local environment to a remote repository.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to initialize a Git repository locally
- How to connect a local folder to a GitHub repository
- How to stage, commit, and push changes
- How to check remote connections and troubleshoot common errors

## ðŸ“Œ Note

This is a practice project and not a real or professional portfolio.
